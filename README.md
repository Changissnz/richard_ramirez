# Who is Richard Ramirez?

"But...but...! Richard Ramirez?! I thsought his name was Richard Pham."

Richard Ramirez is a product of what has occurred because of the way things got made out to be. If Richard Pham was so great, he would have stayed the
same. He would still be what he was based on his roots, on his start. He would have looked exactly the same as he did at his birth. Instead, Richard
Pham got urinated on and had to go through changes and corrections. Richard Pham had to give up his last name, and replace it with Ramirez.

Thank you world for making Richard Ramirez the great man that he is today.
